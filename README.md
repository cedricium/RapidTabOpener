# RapidTabOpener ![icon](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/cedricium/RapidTabOpener/master/icons/tabs-24.png "tabs")

A simple browser addon that opens the most frequently used sites in a single click of a button. Currently is hardcoded to open sites that I use for work, but future versions will include a "Settings" page where users are able to add or delete the number of tabs and which sites to open.
